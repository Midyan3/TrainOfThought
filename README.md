## Why this exists

Our dopamine receptors are constantly yanked back and forth scrolling, scrolling, **nothing**, scrolling again.  
It’s no wonder bottled up emotions leak out as real, physical symptoms: racing hearts, tunnel vision, and, full blown panic attacks.

I’ve been there.  
Panic makes the ordinary *unbearable*.  
I built **Train Of Thought** so anyone can *feel* what a panic attack is like and learn the breathing technique that brings calm when words fail.

If you struggle with anxiety, I hope this lets you practice self-soothing in a safe place.  
If you’ve never experienced it, maybe this will build empathy for those who do.
